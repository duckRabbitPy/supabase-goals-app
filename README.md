I had a lot of fun building this app and learnt a great deal from the experience.

- **Adding goals**: Type in your goal, and hit add goal, it's that simple!

- **Editing goals**: Click edit on a goals of your choice, make changes in the text field and then hit save.

- **Re-ordering goals**: Click the up arrow to bump your goal upwards.

- **Removing or marking-as-done**: Clicking remove will remove your goal from the list, marking as done will also remove from the list but will be recorded so you can see your recent progress.

- **Saving**: When you are happy with the goals you have added, click save.

- **Retrieving**: When you return to your account and you cannot see your saved goals, click retrieve to update the page and get your saved items

- **Sessions**: If you leave the tab open for a long time you may receive an error when trying to save, this is because your session has expired. Simply sign out and sign back in again. To avoid this error always click on the last magic link you were sent when returning, it will either take you to your goals and refresh session or prompt you to sign in.
